CareLoop coordinates fictional referrals through an operational state machine. An agent proposes an eligible provider; a reviewer approves the exact version; closure requires a matching local completion receipt.

## Why this exists

A referral can be sent and still go nowhere. CareLoop models the operational loop: eligibility, ownership, capacity, acceptance, scheduling, completion evidence, and closure. It uses fictional service categories and identifiers.

## Try it in a minute

Python 3.11 or later. The demo needs no packages, account, model download, or API key.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aymaw/careloop.git
cd careloop
python3 -m careloop demo --html .runs/demo.html
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Open `.runs/demo.html` in a browser to inspect the recorded run. JSON is printed
to stdout. The explorer filters records and shows their exact evidence; it does
not execute tools or make network requests. A captured run is in
[`examples/demo.json`](examples/demo.json). Download [`docs/demo.html`](docs/demo.html)
to open the checked-in viewer; GitHub source view does not execute HTML.

```text
DEMO-001: new → routed → accepted → scheduled → completed → closed
DEMO-003: needs_review (no matching capacity)
audit_verified: true
messages sent: 0
```

The default is a **deterministic synthetic demonstration**. The optional model
path calls your explicitly configured endpoint. Demo results are not live model
measurements. All included records and entities are fictional.

## What is implemented

| Capability | Concrete behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Review before routing** | Policy or model proposals are checked against eligible synthetic capacity. |
| **Versioned transitions** | Optimistic concurrency rejects stale proposals and duplicate command conflicts. |
| **Evidence-backed closure** | Closure looks up a completion receipt bound to the same referral. |
| **Audit and outbox** | Hash-linked audit entries and durable message drafts commit with state updates. |

## How it works

```mermaid

  N[New synthetic referral] --> P[Policy or model proposal]
  C[(Synthetic capacity)] --> P
  P --> R[Version-bound review]
  R --> A[Routed and accepted]
  A --> S[Scheduled]
  S --> F[Completion receipt]
  F --> V[Local receipt lookup]
  V --> D[Closed]
  R --> O[(Draft outbox)]
  R --> H[(Hash-linked audit)]
  D --> H
```

The [architecture contract](docs/architecture.md) explains state transitions,
transaction boundaries, failure handling, and the exact guarantees.

## Use it from Python

```python
from careloop.service import CareLoop

app = CareLoop("careloop.sqlite")
try:
    app.add_provider("demo-harbor", "rehab", "north", 2)
    app.create("DEMO-100", "rehab", "north", "demo-owner", "2030-01-01T09:00:00Z")
    proposal = app.propose("DEMO-100")
    app.approve(proposal, "demo-reviewer", "2030-01-01T10:00:00Z", "route-100")
    assert app.get("DEMO-100")["status"] == "routed"
finally:
    app.close()
```

For an installed command, run `python3 -m pip install .`, then `careloop --help`.
Installation needs setuptools as a build dependency; the runtime has no external
dependencies. Module commands above run directly from the checkout offline.

## Bring a model

For a fresh database, first run `python3 -m careloop seed`.

The optional JSON transport works with a compatible local or remote chat endpoint.
It sends no data until a model command is called.

```sh
export MODEL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
export MODEL_NAME=your-installed-model
# For an authenticated endpoint, set MODEL_API_KEY in your environment.
python3 -m careloop propose DEMO-001 --model
```

Use a model already installed at that endpoint. No weights are downloaded or
distributed. Remote endpoints require HTTPS. Redirects are disabled, requests
are bounded to 64 KB, responses to 1 MB, and requests time out after 30 seconds.
Model proposals pass deterministic checks before domain changes. Read the
[transport contract](docs/model-provider.md) and [security notes](SECURITY.md).

## Engineering checks

Legal/illegal transitions, proposal integrity, stale versions, capacity races, duplicate commands, receipt binding, premature completion, audit tampering, and restart persistence.

CI tests, builds and installs the package, checks formatting and lint, compiles
modules, and produces a demo artifact. The configured matrix covers Python
3.11–3.14 on Linux and Python 3.13 on macOS and Windows. A verified green remote
run requires publication and an actual successful Actions run.

```sh
make check
# Optional contributor tooling:
python3 -m pip install '.[dev]'
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
```

## Scope

This is an administrative simulation, not medical software. It performs no
diagnosis, triage, treatment selection, EHR integration, messaging, or real patient
matching. It has no authentication, tenant isolation, calendar integration, or
automatic capacity replenishment. Capacity is a fixed fictional booking allocation.
Receipt lookup verifies a local synthetic record, not an external provider's work.
Reviewer and owner fields are local labels.
